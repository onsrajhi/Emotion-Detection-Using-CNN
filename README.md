# Emotion-detection-using-CNN 

This project ðŸ’ž implements a deep learning-based model for detecting human emotions ðŸ˜ƒ ðŸ˜  ðŸ˜• ...from facial expressions using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model is trained on the [FER2013 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013), which contains facial images categorized into seven different emotions. The project explores multiple approaches, including building a CNN architecture from scratch, enhancing the model using image augmentation, and leveraging transfer learning techniques with VGGNet and ResNet50 to improve accuracy.
